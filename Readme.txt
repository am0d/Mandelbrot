Mandelbrot
----------

This is just a simple Mandelbrot viewer, written in c++ using an SFML front-end.
I wrote it just to get practice with SFML, and to test out another buildit build script.

To compile, first download buildit from http://github.com/sahchandler/buildit/downloads.
Then, run
    python mandelbrot.py
in the current directory.

Controls:
    ESC - quits the program
    R   - resets the zoom and iteration levels
    Click and drag
        - zoom in on a section of the mandelbrot
    Middle scroll wheel
        - increase / decrease the number of iterations

If you modify and release it, you must make your modifications
